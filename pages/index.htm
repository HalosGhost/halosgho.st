            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Though most of my personal projects are end-user facing, almost all my personal and professional programming experience is in lower-level languages (primarily C11). I also have worked with several higher-level languages both personally and professionally (including Lua, Haskell, C#, Python, Java and several others).</p>
            <p>I am a daily user of several linux distributions, and I have professional experience doing day-to-day systems administration and deployment of Linux, Windows and macOS physical and virtual machines.</p>
            <!--<p>My full CV may be found <a href="files/cv.pdf">here</a> and a one-page resume may be found <a href="files/resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>-->

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Though <code>shaman</code> and <code>pbpst</code> are fairly stable, none of these projects are complete; there are still many more things I would like to implement in all of them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/HalosGhost/shaman">shaman</a>, a simple CLI weather program</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/HalosGhost/pbpst">pbpst</a>, a simple, but featureful pastebin client for <a href="https://github.com/ptpb/pb">pb</a> deployments</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/HalosGhost/adarcroom">adarcroom</a>, a C/ncurses port of <a href="http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/">A Dark Room</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/HalosGhost/.bin">.bin</a>, a set of small, helpful utilities</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/HalosGhost/.dotfiles">.dotfiles</a>, my Linux userspace configurations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Academic Work</h2>
            <p>I graduated with Latin and departmental honors from <a href="https://macalester.edu">Macalester College</a> class of 2014, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science. You can view the full text of my honors' thesis on <a href="https://github.com/HalosGhost/honors_thesis">GitHub</a>.</p>
            <h2>Work in Progress</h2>
            <p>This site is in the middle of a heavy rewrite and does not support many of the security features (i.e., TLS and HSTS) that it eventually will. Keep an eye out for updates!</p>
