This is my homepage, rewritten from the ground up in lwan so it is entirely in C.
In the beginning, it will be nothing flashy (very similar to the Haskell version), but I plan to add project pages for my various projects and perhaps a few other fancy things.

One of my goals in the rewrite is to have no regressions in security/privacy or standard-compliance.
