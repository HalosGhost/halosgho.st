This is my homepage.
It is incredibly simple; nothing flashy whatsoever.
However, it is completely written in Haskell using several cool technologies which allow me to type-check the page for correctness before I even open it in a web browser.

It still is not complete, but it is not far away.
While the content of the site itself pertains specifically to me and I would rather it not be copied, the source of the page is completely free and open under the terms of the GPL (version 3).
Feel free to take a look at and learn from the source.

While it is a simple page, its setup boasts some fancy things that many sites these days do not have:

- `Valid HTML5 with no warnings or errors <https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https://halosgho.st/>`_
- `An A+ Rating from SSLLabs <https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=https://halosgho.st>`_
- `99% and 100% on PageSpeed and YSlow (respectively) <https://gtmetrix.com/reports/halosgho.st/ABt1HbMh>`_
- `Full HTTP2 support with ALPN <https://tools.keycdn.com/http2-test?url=https://halosgho.st>`_
