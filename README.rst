This is my homepage.
It is incredibly simple; nothing flashy whatsoever.
However, it is completely written in Haskell using several cool technologies which allow me to type-check the page for correctness before I even open it in a web browser.

It still is not complete, but it is not far away.
While the content of the site itself pertains specifically to me and I would rather it not be copied, the source of the page is completely free and open under the terms of the GPL (version 3).
Feel free to take a look at and learn from the source.
